# Guess the Number Game

This simple console-based game is created using C language as a practice project for my college exam. The game utilizes a do-while loop to allow players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## Game Description

In this game, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player's objective is to guess this number within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback to help the player narrow down their guesses.

## How to Play

1. **Launch the Game:**
   - Compile and run the `guess_the_number.c` file in a C compiler.

2. **Game Rules:**
   - The computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
   - You need to guess this number within a limited number of attempts.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - Enter your guess when prompted.
   - The game will inform you if your guess is too high or too low.
   - Keep guessing until you guess the correct number or run out of attempts.

4. **Winning:**
   - If you guess the correct number within the allowed attempts, you win!
   - The game will display the number of attempts it took you to guess correctly.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
- `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h` standard libraries for input/output and random number generation.
- Do-while loop for iterative gameplay.

## Development Notes

- This game is created purely for educational and practice purposes.
- Feel free to explore the code (`guess_the_number.c`) to understand the logic and implementation.
- Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are welcome.
